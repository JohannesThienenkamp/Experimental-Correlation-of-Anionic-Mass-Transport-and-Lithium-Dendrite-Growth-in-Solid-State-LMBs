MATLab script to calculate anion drift velocities from 19F MRI profiles in LMBs

How to use the MATLab Code - Step-by-Step

- open MATLab Version R2021a
- open MATLab script "Anion_Masstransport_protocol_NMC_Li.m" in folder "NMC622_Li"
- run MATLab script "Anion_Masstransport_protocol_NMC_Li.m".
- Select "Change Folder" as soon as an error message appears indicating that script "Anion_Masstransport_protocol_NMC_Li.m" is not found in the current folder
- An "Input" prompt with given input paramaters specific for each data set appears. Please confirm the parameters by clicking on "ok".
- A second prompt appears: Navigate to the specific data folder and open the folder "Data" (don't be confused if the folder appears empty in the prompt. Proceed). Close the prompt by clicking on "Choose Folder".
- The data input prompt will be closed and the calculation starts as indicated by computed numbers in the "Command Window" of MATLab.
- Finally, the published "Anion Drift Velocity" Figure (part of Figure 3 of the manuscript) and a "Concentration Profile" Figure appear.

Thank you for using the MATLab code.
